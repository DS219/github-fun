## Tips!
If you get lost in your terminal, the following will help you:

`cd ~` takes you back to your home directory.  

`cd ~/<repo>`, where `<repo>` is the name of your repo, takes you inside your local git repo, assuming you cloned it into your home directory.  

`ls` lists all the files and folders in the current directory.  

`pwd` prints the name and path of the current directory.
